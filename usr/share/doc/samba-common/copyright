 Neither this notice nor Microsoft's delivery of the documentation grants any
 licenses under those or any other Microsoft patents. However, the protocols
 may be covered by Microsoft's Open Specification Promise (available here:

 publicly available standard specifications and network programming art,
 and assumes that the reader either is familiar with the aforementioned
 material or has immediate access to it. A protocol specification does not
 require the use of Microsoft programming tools or programming environments
 in order for you to develop an implementation. If you have access to
 Microsoft programming tools and environments you are free to take
 advantage of them.
